    "# 🏦 Gatekeeper CTF Challenge — Level 4: The Model That Refused to Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Happened So Far?\n",
    "\n",
    "The thief who once tried to trick the village Gatekeeper has turned his life around completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "After realising the villagers were innocent and making peace with his past, he left the village and started fresh. He studied hard, built new skills, and eventually landed a job at a bank — working in their data and analytics team.\n",
    "\n",
    "He is no longer a thief. He is now a data engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "The bank's analytics team has built an AI **Sentinel** — a model designed to predict which customers are likely to subscribe to a term deposit. This is important for the bank's marketing team to know who to target.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sentinel's design looks solid on paper. The engineers put a lot of thought into it — multiple layers, regularisation, normalisation. Everything seems right.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Sentinel refuses to learn.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time it trains, the loss barely changes. The ROC-AUC score sits around 0.50 — no better than a random guess. The marketing team is frustrated. The engineers are confused and blaming each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody can figure out what is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new employee — our reformed thief — has been asked to step in and take a look. He is good at finding things others miss. After all, he once found every weakness in the Gatekeeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Your Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You are in his shoes now. Look through the training pipeline carefully and **find the bugs that are stopping the Sentinel from learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you fix them, the Sentinel should train properly and perform well on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "- You may modify anything in the training pipeline code\n",
    "- Run your fixed model on the test set\n",
    "- Save the predicted probabilities to `predictions.csv` (a single column named `prediction`)\n",
    "- 📤 **Submit only the `predictions.csv` file** on the challenge platform — do NOT submit the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏁 Success Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform will evaluate your `predictions.csv` against the true test labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ROC-AUC ≥ 0.85  →  🏴 Flag Revealed\n",
    "ROC-AUC < 0.85  →  ❌ Try again\n",
