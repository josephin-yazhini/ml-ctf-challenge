    "# 🏰 Gatekeeper CTF Challenge — Level 3: Fix the Gatekeeper\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Story So Far\n",
    "\n",
    "You remember the thief from the previous challenges — the one the Gatekeeper kept flagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "He did not see himself as a criminal. He believed the villagers were greedy and corrupt, hoarding resources while others suffered. That belief is what drove him to tamper with the Gatekeeper and sneak past it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But once he was inside the village, he saw the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The villagers were not corrupt at all. They were ordinary, hardworking, honest people — just trying to live peacefully. Everything he had assumed about them was wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thief felt ashamed. He gave up his old ways and chose to stay, living among the villagers and quietly making up for what he had done.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The New Threat\n",
    "\n",
    "But peace did not last.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word spread to the outside world that the Gatekeeper had been fooled — twice. Now a **group of real thieves** is on its way to the village, hoping to take advantage of the situation and slip through the gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gatekeeper should be the village's first line of defence, but there is a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all the tampering from the previous challenges, **the Gatekeeper's internal knowledge has been corrupted**. It no longer makes correct decisions. It is flagging innocent citizens as thieves and failing to catch the dangerous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The village is at risk, and there is no time to retrain the Gatekeeper from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Your Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to fix the Gatekeeper so it can protect the village again.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given:\n",
    "- The **dataset** — the true records of every person, showing who is a Citizen and who is a Thief\n",
    "- The **corrupted model** — the Gatekeeper in its current broken state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your goal is to fix the Gatekeeper so it correctly classifies every single person in the dataset.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraint: **you cannot retrain the model**. No fitting allowed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has two classes:\n",
    "- **Label = 0 → Citizen** (innocent villager)\n",
    "- **Label = 1 → Thief** (known criminal)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "- Do **not** call `.fit()` on the model — retraining is not allowed\n",
    "- Use only the loaded model and the dataset\n",
    "- 📤 **Submit only the `fixed_model.pkl` file** on the challenge platform — do NOT submit the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **The model must achieve exactly 100% accuracy on the dataset. Anything less will not be accepted.**\n",
